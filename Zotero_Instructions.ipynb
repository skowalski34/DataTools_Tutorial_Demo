    "Zotero is a software that is a way to manage references. Zotero will keep track and help to manage all sorts of different files. It is simple to add references to Zotero, a click or  one drag and drop is all one needs to add a reference to their library. Citation information can be kept and organized with Zotero.

    "Zotero is a free citation manager that will allow you to collect, organize, share, and cite research items. Zotero offers local storage of data on your own computer, online access to your data, and browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox to ingest bibliographic metadata to ease the collection of citations. ZoteroBib (a separate tool) will help you create a quick bibliography through manually entering items or ingesting metadata from library catalogs, newspapers, magazines, ISBNs, DOIs, and more. ZoteroBib generates citations in a browser that can be pasted into a research paper in an array of citation styles including MLA, APA, and Chicago. This digital tool is better suited for short-term research and/or assignment needs."
